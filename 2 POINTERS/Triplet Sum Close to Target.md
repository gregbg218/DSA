Sure, let me simplify the approach and explain it step by step:

1. First, the method checks if the input array is null or has less than 3 elements. If so, it throws an exception as we can't find a triplet in such cases.

2. Then, it sorts the array in ascending order. This helps us efficiently search for the triplet.

3. It initializes a variable smallestDifference to keep track of the smallest difference between the target sum and the sum of the current triplet.

4. It starts a loop that fixes the first number of the triplet. For each fixed first number, it uses two pointers, left and right, to find the other 
two numbers of the triplet.

5. Inside the while loop, it calculates the difference between the target sum and the sum of the current triplet (targetDiff).

6. If targetDiff is zero, it means we've found a triplet with an exact sum, so we return the target sum.

7. If the absolute value of targetDiff is smaller than the absolute value of smallestDifference, or if they are equal but targetDiff is 
positive (meaning we've found a sum closer to the target), it updates smallestDifference.

8. If targetDiff is positive, it means we need to increase the triplet sum, so it moves the left pointer to the right.(triplet sum < target sum)

9. If targetDiff is negative, it means we need to decrease the triplet sum, so it moves the right pointer to the left.(triplet sum > target sum)

10. The while loop continues until the left pointer crosses the right pointer.

11. After the loop ends, the method returns **targetSum - smallestDifference**, which is the sum of the triplet closest to the target sum.

In essence, the approach uses the two-pointer technique to efficiently search for the triplet. By sorting the array and strategically moving 
the pointers based on the difference between the current sum and the target sum, it narrows down the search space and finds the closest sum.
