2 approaches to 2 pointer

In problems where we deal with **sorted arrays** (or linked-lists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill 
certain constraints, the Two Pointers approach becomes quite useful. The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet
or even a subarray. For example, take a look at the following problem:

2 sum problem and remove duplicates



Now there can be 2 approaches :

1st approach: left pointer at start and right pointer at end of array

2nd approach: left and right pointers both starting at start or end
