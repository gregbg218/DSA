// Here we are using 2 past questions Minimum number of Deletions to make palindrome and Longest Palindromic SubSequence
// Basically if string = abffea then to make palindrome using deletions we get palindromic subsequence as affa and we need to make 2 deletions
// b and e

// Now the thing is this is same as saying if we insert an "e" after "b" and a "b" after the 2nd last "e" then it becomes a palindrome
// So basically number of deletions= no of insertions
