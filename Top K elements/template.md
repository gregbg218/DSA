How to identify such sums?

Ans Whenever given questions where "k elemnts" and "smallest or largest" is given then apply "Top K elements" approach and use a heap.




Also any sorting questionwhere this approach is used first offer alternative to this approach by saying we can sort the array by using merge sort with time complexity of nlogn but we use the "Top K elements" approach because it does the work in nlogk (k<n and n is total size of array)



Also when question says find top k elements then use minHeap and when smallest k elements use Max Heap
