Go with fast and slow approach

Slow moves 1 and fastmoves 2 

Let both meet 


Since fast pointer travels double the distance covered by slow

So nC-K is the number of cycles travelled minus the distance of the meeting point of fast and slow from the start of the cycle
(K is the distance of the meeting point from the start)
