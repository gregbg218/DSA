1. The `ListNode` class represents a node in the linked list. Each node has a value (`val`) and a reference to the next node (`next`). The constructor `ListNode(int val)` initializes a node with the given value.

2. The `Solution` class contains the main logic for finding the start of the cycle in a linked list.

3. The `findCycleStart` method takes the head of the linked list as input and returns the node where the cycle starts.

4. Inside `findCycleStart`, we first use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to detect the presence of a cycle. We initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head of the linked list.

5. In each iteration, the `slow` pointer moves one step forward, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps forward. If there is a cycle, the `slow` and `fast` pointers will eventually meet at a node inside the cycle.

6. If a cycle is found, we calculate the length of the cycle by moving the `slow` pointer one step at a time until it completes one full cycle and returns to the meeting point. The `calculateCycleLength` method performs this operation and returns the length of the cycle.

7. Once we have the length of the cycle, we use the `findStart` method to find the start of the cycle. We initialize two pointers, `pointer1` and `pointer2`, both pointing to the head of the linked list.

8. We move `pointer2` ahead by `cycleLength` nodes, while keeping `pointer1` at the head.

9. Then, we increment both `pointer1` and `pointer2` one step at a time until they meet. The node where they meet is the start of the cycle.

10. The `main` method demonstrates the usage of the `findCycleStart` method. It creates a linked list with nodes and sets up different cycle scenarios by connecting the last node to a specific node in the list.

11. For each cycle scenario, the `findCycleStart` method is called, and the value of the node where the cycle starts is printed.

The code leverages the fact that if we move two pointers, one from the head and the other from a node `cycleLength` steps ahead, they will meet at the start of the cycle. This is because the distance between the head and the start of the cycle is equal to the distance between the meeting point (where `slow` and `fast` pointers meet) and the start of the cycle.

Overall, this code provides an efficient solution to find the start of a cycle in a singly linked list using Floyd's algorithm and the two-pointer approach.
