So this keeps on happening, now u may wonder isnt it better in taking the number only once and squaring and adding it till 1 but the thing is it may never reach 1 instead it may keep on going on an and on in loop and to find whether its going in loops we need to have a list of visited elemnts which further consumes space
instead the above soln consumes 0 space
