THere are 3 approaches for soling recursion problem so for a problem we go one by one to check which is applicable

1) Base Induction Hypothesis method
2) Recursion Tree(input output method)
3) Choice diagram method(used in Dynamic programming)

from 11:58 to 13:20<br />

It is mostly used in tree and linked list problem<br />
<br />

<br />
THE TASK IS TO PRINT FROM 1 TO N
<br />
<br />
BUT WHEN WE HAVE TO PRINT FROM N TO 1 WE CAN CHANGE POSITION OF INDUCTION STEP<br />

<br />
Whenever we are asked to reduce the input till 0 then we use this approach<br />
<br />
<br />
Best example to learn this method:<br />

from 19:35 to 24:53<br /><br />
Whenever we are asked to make a choice and decision in a problem then we use this approach<br />
<br />
<br />
