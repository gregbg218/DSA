Here at each step we have 2 operators so only 2 branches but this wont be so in all cases.

Example if at a particular step there were 4 operators then it would have 4 branches but of course at every branch we can only divide it into 2 sub-branches.

As a result for the 4 operators we use for-loop and for the 2 sub-branches we use 2 recursion calls
