Basically the problem says u have 2 baskets , 1 basket can contain only 1 type of fruit and any number of fruits of that type 

We can start from any index but we cant skip we need to go in sequence no matter what start index u choose

Our goal is to fill the 2 baskets with maximum fruits and so we need to accordingly choose the starting index that gives us that

You cant pick 2 A's and 2 C's because if u start at any point in the array u cant skip the consecutive trees/
