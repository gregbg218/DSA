k is number of characters we are allowed to replace
(windowEnd - windowStart + 1 - maxRepeatLetterCount )
which is basically window length-maxRepeatLetterCount = number of non repeating characters

basically (window length-maxRepeatLetterCount) should be equal to k for a window to qualify and so we the largest such qualifying window is the answer

if (windowEnd - windowStart + 1 - maxRepeatLetterCount > k
then we shrink the window from the left as it means there's too many characters to replace
