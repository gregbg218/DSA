Basically we need to find if the permutation exists as a single continuous substring

Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The `findPermutation` method takes two strings, `str` and `pattern`, as input.

2. It initializes variables `windowStart` and `matched` to keep track of the starting index of the current window and the number of characters matched in the current window, respectively.

3. It creates a `charFrequencyMap` using a HashMap to store the frequency of each character in the `pattern`.

4. It iterates through the characters of `str` using the `windowEnd` variable.

5. For each character at `windowEnd`:
   - If the character is present in the `charFrequencyMap`, it decrements its frequency in the map.
   - If the frequency of the character becomes zero, it means the character is completely matched, so it increments the `matched` count.
   - If the `matched` count becomes equal to the size of `charFrequencyMap`, it means a permutation of the pattern is found in the current window, so it returns `true`.

6. If the window size (`windowEnd - windowStart + 1`) becomes equal to the length of the `pattern`, it shrinks the window by moving the `windowStart` pointer to the right:
   - It retrieves the character at `windowStart` and checks if it is present in the `charFrequencyMap`.
   - If the character's frequency in the map is zero, it means the character was completely matched, so it decrements the `matched` count.
   - It increments the character's frequency in the map to indicate that the character is no longer matched.

7. If no permutation of the pattern is found after iterating through all the characters of `str`, it returns `false`.

There is mistake in the code providedo n the site:
You are absolutely right. The condition if (windowEnd >= pattern.length() - 1) is not the correct way to check if the window size is equal to the length of the pattern.
The correct condition should be:
javaCopy codeif (windowEnd - windowStart + 1 >= pattern.length()) {
    // shrink the window by one character
    // ...
}
Here's the corrected code snippet:
javaCopy codeif (windowEnd - windowStart + 1 >= pattern.length()) { // shrink the window by one character
    char leftChar = str.charAt(windowStart++);
    if (charFrequencyMap.containsKey(leftChar)) {
        if (charFrequencyMap.get(leftChar) == 0)
            matched--; // before putting the char back, decrement the matched count
        // put the character back for matching
        charFrequencyMap.put(leftChar, charFrequencyMap.get(leftChar) + 1);
    }
}
The condition windowEnd - windowStart + 1 >= pattern.length() checks if the current window size is greater than or equal to the length of the pattern. This ensures that the window is shrunk only when its size becomes equal to or exceeds the pattern length.
Thank you for pointing out the mistake. The rest of the code remains the same, and the overall logic of the sliding window technique is still valid
